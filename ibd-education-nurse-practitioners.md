# Goals of Caring for Patients with IBD

---

## Goals to be Covered
- [Goal #1: Disease Classification](#3)
- [Goal #2: Disease Management Strategy](#9)
- Goal #3: Treatment (to be covered in other lectures)
- [Goal #4: Monitoring](#10)
- [Goal #5: Taking Care of the Whole Patient](#11)

---

## Goal 1: Disease Classification<sup>1</sup>
Aim to idenfity:
- IBD Type
- Location and extend of inflammation
- Disease phenotype
- Disease activity: snashot in time
- Disease severity

---

## Crohn's Disease Burden: Low Risk<sup>2</sup>
<!-- _backgroundColor: white -->
![w:1100](d1.png)

---

# Crohn's Disease Burden: Moderate to High Risk<sup>3</sup>
<!-- _backgroundColor: white -->
![w:1100](d2.png)

---

## Disease Activity: Crohn's Disease<sup>4</sup>
- Categories include: remission, mild, moderate, and severe
- Based upon subjective measures including symptoms, QOL, and disease complications
- Can use scoring subsystems like Harvey Bradshaw, Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) but misleading

---

## Ulcerative Colitis Burden: Risk for Colectomy<sup>5</sup>

---

## Goal #2: Disease Management Strategy<sup>7</sup>
- Upon diagnosis, must provide patients with education regarding chronicity and need for ongoing therapy
- Aim to induce remission
- Avoidance of long-term exposure to steroid-based treatment regimens
- Aim to maintain remission

---

## Goal #4: Monitoring
- Historically, we assessed based on symptoms only; objective evaluation is a relatively recent paradigm shift
- Objective evaluation includes:
  - Non-invasive markers of inflammation: C-reactive protein (CRP) and fecal calprotectin)
  - Enterography
  - Colonoscopy
- Use of **treat-to-target*- approach to optimize treatment strategy and achieve remission
- Mucosal healing is a goal of therapy
- Long-term observational studies in Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis are still needed to assess the utility of the treat to target strategy

--- 

## Goal #5: Taking Care of the Whole Patient<sup>8</sup>


- Comprehensive care in IBD to address all aspects of disease and health needs
- Disease features warrant expertise beyond the gastroenterologist in order to provide complete care
  - Chronic, lifelong illness
  - Medical and surgical needs
  - Numerous extra-intestinal aspects of disease

## Total Care - IBD<sup>9</sup>

<!-- _backgroundColor: white -->

![h:500](d4.png)

---

## Under One Roof...<sup>10</sup>

Proposed collaborative care environments:
- Med/surg
  - Includes radiologist
  - Pouch clinics
- Pregnancy/preconception
  - Includes MFM specialist
  - Addresses fertility, pre-conception, therapy, delivery

---

## Under One Roof... (Continued)<sup>10</sup>
- Transition of care
  - Includes adult/child-centered care providers and support services
- Psychosocial care
- Nutrition
- Multidisciplinary conferences

---

## Preventive Care in IBD<sup>11</sup>
- For many patients, the gastroenterologist is the only provider
- Data suggest IBD patients do not receive preventive services at the same rate as general medicine patients
- Debate as to who “owns”- healthcare maintenance in IBD patient

---

## Preventive Care in IBD<sup>12</sup>
- Health maintenance is aimed at prevention and health promotion
- Areas of the focus are highlighted in 2017 ACG preventive care in IBD guideline:
  - Vaccinations
  - Skin cancer screening
  - Cervical cancer screening
  - Osteoporosis screening
  - Smoking cessation
  - Assessment for depression and anxiety

---

## Remember...
- Appreciate that “it takes a village” to effectively care for IBD 
- Be aware of preventive healthcare needs 
- Utilize IBD centers for patients with complex IBD
- Consider available resources/team members to aid in managing patients with IBD

---

## 5-Aminosalicylates (5-ASAs) <sup>2</sup>

- Modulate inflammatory cytokine production, decrease transcriptional activity of nuclear factor-kappa ß (NF-κ ß), inhibit production of prostaglandin and leukotrienes
  - **Work without affecting systemic immune system
- Topical contact with inflamed mucosa required; oral and rectal formulations available
- First line for induction and maintenance of mild to moderate ulcerative colitis

---

## 5-Aminosalicylates (5-ASAs) (Continued) <sup>2</sup>
- Debated use in Crohn’s disease
  - Cochrane analysis noted sulfasalazine is superior to placebo for inducing remission in Crohn’s colitis (45% vs 29%; RR 1.38, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.89) at 17-18 weeks

---

## Rectally Introduced 5-ASAs <sup>3</sup>

- Ideal for treating disease within 50cm from the anus or distal to the splenic flexure
- Superior to topical steroids
- 2010 Cochrane review confirmed that topical 5-ASA therapy achieves induction of remission in 67% of patients with mild to moderate disease
- Doses of at least 1g/day are warranted
- Compliance and acceptance of this strategy are integral to its success

---

## Rectally applied 5-ASA Formulations

- First-line agents for proctitis and left-sided colitis (ulcerative colitis)
- Ideal for management of tenesmus, urgency, rectal pain, incontinence, bleeding, and paradoxical constipation

(mesalamine)&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;(mesalamine*)

*Foam formulation is not available in the USA

---

## Oral ASAs <sup>4</sup>

- Systematic review and meta-analysis show efficacy for inducing remission and preventing relapse
- Doses of ≥ 2.0g/day have greater efficacy than lower doses
- Moderate disease had improvements in clinical symptoms and rates of remission with 4.8g vs 2.4g
- All formulations show similar systemic absorption, pharmacokinetics, excretion
- Once daily dosing is comparable to divided dosing
- Decision-making based on clinical response, toxicity, compliance, and cost

---

## Oral 5-ASA Formulations

<style scoped>
  table {
    font-size: 30px;
  }
</style>

| Type | Mechanism of Action |
| - | - |
| Diffusion–dependent (**mesalamine**, controlled release) | Time-released, coated in ethylcellulose, and releases starting in upper small bowel |
| pH-dependent(mesalamine,delayed release formulations,  multi-matrix system [MMX] mesalamine) | Coated with acrylate resin and released at pH 6.0-7.0 (distal ileum or proximal colon) |
| Colonic flora-dependent; azo-bonded (sulfasalazine, balsalazide, olsalazine) | 3 different types of azo-bonded 5-ASAs, which are cleaved by colonic bacteria when the drug reaches the colon |

---

## 5-ASAs: Combined Oral & Topical Approach <sup>5</sup>

<style scoped>
  li {
    font-size: 32px;
  }
</style>

- Meta-analysis by Ford et al evaluated oral vs topical vs combined 5-ASA therapy
  - Combined 5-ASA therapy was superior to oral 5-ASA alone for induction of remission of mildly to moderately active extensive ulcerative colitis
  - Trend toward superiority of topical over oral approach in distal ulcerative colitis
- No data on optimal dosing with this approach
- Patients who continue on the same dose from time of initiation maintain remission more frequently than those that dose de-escalate

---

## 5-ASAs: Side Effects

<style scoped>
  li {
    font-size: 32px;
  }
</style>

- Common: headache, hair loss
- Hypersensitivities
- Sulfa moiety in sulfasalazine is responsible for:
  - Hemolytic anemia
  - Reversible hypospermia, decreased sperm motility
  - Allergic phenomena
  - Nausea
- Monitoring
  - Periodic BUN and creatinine, given rare idiosyncratic cases of interstitial nephritis

---

## Corticosteroids <sup>6</sup>
- Prevent migration of inflammatory mediators to the GI tract
- Interfere with production of nuclear factor-kappa ß (NF-
- Used to induce remission in both ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease
- Parenteral, oral, and rectal formulations 
- Budesonide exhibits 90% first-pass metabolism, formulated to treat local activity
- No role for long term maintenance therapy, given side effect profile

---

## Corticosteroids: Oral Use <sup>7</sup>
- Optimum dose unclear; common use prednisone 40mg (0.5-0.75mg/kg/day) for acute symptoms
- Doses of 60mg have moderately more efficacy but at the expense of side effects
- Budesonide MMX induced clinical and endoscopic remission in 17.7% of mild to moderate ulcerative colitis patients vs 6.2% receiving placebo by 8 weeks

---

## Corticosteroids: Oral Use (Continued)
- Budesonide (enteric coated) 9mg daily is superior to placebo in induction of symptomatic remission in mild to moderate Crohn’s disease
- Standard steroids are more efficacious than budesonide preparations

---

## Corticosteroids: De-escalation <sup>8</sup>
- Have an Exit Strategy! Tapering needs to be considered as soon as steroids are initiated to avoid adverse outcomes
- Appropriate maintenance therapy should be in place
- Once clinical response achieved, doses are tapered by 5–10mg/week until 20mg 
- Once at 20mg daily, the taper should be slowed to reduction of  2.5–5mg/week

---

## Corticosteroids: Rectal Use <sup>9</sup>
- Topical steroids are first line for those intolerant to 5-ASA topical preparations
- Best to treat symptoms of tenesmus, urgency, rectal pain, incontinence, and bleeding
- Maybe adjunctive to topical 5-ASA therapy
- Foam and liquid enema preparations 
- Meta-analysis of budesonide foam noted that is was superior to placebo for induction of clinical remission in mild to moderate ulcerative colitis

- Glucose intolerance
- Dermatologic consequences (striae, acne)
- Infections

- Weight gain
- Glaucoma
- Bone loss
- Avascular necrosis 
- Psychiatric symptoms

## Antibiotics <sup>10</sup>
- Use investigated due to theory that immune response to flora drives inflammation in Crohn’s disease
- Strategies evaluated include:
  - **Ciprofloxacin**
    - Similar efficacy to mesalamine 
    - No more effective than placebo for induction of remission
  - **Metronidazole**
    - No more effective than placebo
  - **Antimycobacterial agents**
    - No more effective than placebo

<style scoped>
  li {
    font-size: 32px;

## Immunomodulators <sup>11</sup>
- The “original” drugs for steroid-dependent or steroid-refractory patients
- These include:
  - **Thiopurines:*- azathioprine (AZA) and 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP)
    - Purine antagonists
    - Cause DNA damage, cell-cycle arrest, cytotoxicity, and apoptosis
  - **Methotrexate**
    - Converted to methotrexate-polyglutamate, which blocks de novo purine synthesis and dihydrofolate reductase, resulting in reduced inflammation and increased apoptosis

---

<style scoped>
  li {
    font-size: 30px;
  }
</style>

## Immunomodulators <sup>12</sup>
- Lack of robust data
- Have been used for nearly 40 years for IBD
- Used for maintenance of remission; no role for induction, given delayed onset of activity (~8-12 weeks)
- Thiopurines are used in Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis
- AZA use more common as 6-MP does not have IBD-approved indication worldwide
- Small studies support the use of methotrexate in Crohn’s disease
- Based on existing data, currently no recommendation for methotrexate in ulcerative colitis

---

<style scoped>
  li {
    font-size: 28px;
  }
</style>

## AZA and 6-MP: Thiopurine S-Methyltransferase Testing (TPMT) <sup>14</sup>
- Some societies recommend checking TMPT prior to starting an immunomodulator
- Risk of myelosuppression with AZA and 6-MP due to elevated levels of 6-TGN
- Genotype and phenotype testing available
  - 89% wild type ⮕ normal or high TPMT activity
  - 10% heterozygous for mutations ⮕ low TPMT activity
  - 0.3% homozygous for mutations ⮕ negligible TPMT activity
- TPMT activity level can vary based on other medication exposure
- Recently discovered *NUDT15 R139C- variation can induced leukopenia in Asians
- Not all mutations are detectable, so CBC and liver enzymes must be followed periodically regardless of TMPT results

---

<style scoped>
  li {
    font-size: 30px;
  }
</style>

## AZA and 6-MP: Monitoring <sup>15</sup>
- Baseline CBC and liver enzymes: every other week for 6 to 8 weeks after initiation or following any dose adjustments; at least once every 3 months thereafter 
- 6-thioguanine (6-TGN) and 6-methylmercaptopurine (6-MMP) levels can be measured: 2013 meta-analysis showed the pooled odds ratio for clinical remission was 3.2 when 6-TGN levels were between 230 and 260 (95% CI 2.4-4.1)
- 6-TGN levels >400 picomoles per 8 X 108 erythrocytes predict refractoriness and an increased risk of myelotoxicity 
- 6-MMP levels >5000 picomoles per 8 X 108 erythrocytes correlates with hepatotoxicity 

---

<style scoped>
  table {
    font-size: 23px;

</style>

## AZA and 6-MP: Monitoring <sup>16</sup>
| Patient Classification | 6-TGN | 6-MMP | Consequence | Approach |
| - | - | - | - | - |
| Non-compliance | Negligible or undetectable | Negligible or undetectable | Inefficacy | Patient education |
| Underdosing | Low | Low | Inefficacy or poor response | Increase thiopurine dosage |
| Thiopurine “resistant” | Low | High | Poor response or hepatotoxicity | Add allopurinol and decrease thiopurine dosage |
| Overdosing | High | Low | Overdosing with risk of myelotoxicity | Decrease thiopurine dosage and close monitoring |
| Thiopurine “refractory” | High | High | Thiopurine refractory or overdose | Switch to another drug |

---

## AZA and 6-MP: The “Resistant” Patient <sup>17</sup>
- Characterized by low 6-TGN levels, high 6-MMP levels and often transaminitis
- Allopurinol 100mg daily directs reaction away from 6-MMP towards 6-TGN
- Requires dose reduction of AZA or 6-MP by 25%-50% to avoid myelotoxicity
- Bi-weekly CBCs needed during this adjustment phase
- Metabolite levels reassessed within 2-6 weeks

## Targets of IBD Therapeutics<sup>2</sup>

![w:1100](d8.png)

---

# Biologics: Anti-TNF-α Agents

---

## Anti-Tumor Necrosis Factor-αAgents (Anti-TNFs) <sup>3</sup>

- Blocks TNF-α, a cytokine, which modulates immune reactions as an acute phase reactant as well as impacting cell migration, proliferation, and cell death
- Used in Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis for disease refractory to steroids or when unable to achieve steroid sparing with other agents OR to induce remission in those presenting with more severe disease
- Often used in combination with immunomodulators

---

## Anti-Tumor Necrosis Factor-αAgents (Anti-TNFs) (Continued)

- Relatively rapid onset of action (within 2 weeks)
- Prior to initiation must assess for risk of latent or active TB and hepatitis B status

---

## Anti-TNFs<sup>4</sup>

![w:1100](d9.png)

---

## Infliximab

- First anti-TNF agent indicated in the treatment of IBD (1998)
- Only FDA-approved agent for fistulizing Crohn’s disease
- Chimeric in nature; mouse/human
- Infusion-based treatment
- Dosing: 
  - Induction: dose @ 0, 2, and 6 weeks 
  - Maintenance: every 8 weeks
  - Infusion takes ~2 hours

#### Combination Anti-TNF and Immunomodulator Treatment <sup>5</sup>

![w:600 bg right](d10.png)

- Combination therapy is favorable as anti-TNFs are immunogenic
- Results in:
  - Reducing anti-drug antibodies 
  - Boosting anti-TNF drug levels
- Data for combination is with anti-TNF medications; mainly infliximab with azathioprine
- SONIC trial noted superiority of infliximab + azathioprine compared to either agent alone to achieve steroid-free remission at 26 weeks in CD; UC SUCCESS noted same finding at 16 weeks in UC

# Management of Loss of Response to IBD Therapies

---

## Why Is This Topic Important?<sup>1</sup>
- Since IBD is a chronic, inflammatory disease, it’s important to monitor patients to ensure continued response to therapeutic strategy over time
- If symptoms recur, must confirm symptoms reported are truly related to underlying persistent inflammation
- Other etiologies that can have similar symptoms to IBD won’t respond to IBD treatments!

---

## Non-IBD Causes of Diarrhea (in the IBD Patient)
- Non-compliance
- C. difficile
  - Previous antibiotic use is not required to develop this infection
  - Usually no pseudomembranes
  - Higher morbidity and mortality rates 
  - Increased colectomy rate as high as 20%
- Neoplasm

---

## Non-IBD Causes of Diarrhea (in the IBD Patient)
- Medications  (NSAIDs, antibiotics)
- Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth
  - Can be seen in 25% of patients with Crohn’s disease
  - Risk factors: longer duration of disease, fibrostenotic disease, colonic involvement, previous/multiple surgical procedures
- Bile-salt diarrhea
  - Most commonly seen with ileal resection
- Overlapping Irritable Bowel Syndrome

---

## How to Assess the Patient with Loss of Response
- Detailed history on behaviors: 
  - smoking cessation in UC
  - New meds
  - Dietary indiscretion
- Stool studies to rule out infection
- Bloodwork including CRP level
- Fecal calprotectin level
- Colonoscopy and or cross-sectional imaging


---

## Loss of Response When Nothing Else Is to Blame...
*Maybe the medication regimen is the problem?!*
- Drug monitoring has been used for years; initially with the immunomodulator medications
- Drug monitoring with biologics is utilized more frequently today; the most data are available for infliximab (our oldest biologic medication)

---

## Why Is This TDM Important?<sup>2</sup>
- Biologics are very effective for moderate to severe IBD. 
- Nevertheless: 
  - 10%-30% of patients have primary non-response (total lack of clinical response to induction doses) 
  - Up to 50% of patients who initially respond have a secondary loss of response or serious adverse event
  - Most data on this topic exist for anti-TNF medications

## Pharmacokinetics of Anti-TNF Agents<sup>3</sup>
Low albumin | Increased clearance
| - | - 
CRP level | Higher CRP = increased clearance
Body mass index (BMI) | Higher BMI = increased clearance
Male sex | Increased clearance

---

## Therapeutic Drug Monitoring<sup>4</sup>
- Measures serum drug concentration and anti-drug antibodies
- Can be used to optimize biologic therapy and improve therapeutic decision making 
  - Optimal serum drug concentrations are associated with favorable outcomes in **retrospective*- analyses
  - Low or undetectable drug concentrations are linked to anti-drug antibody formation and subsequent treatment failure

---

# Therapeutic Drug Monitoring (Continued)
*
  - Drug concentrations can be directly compared between the different assays (eg, Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA], radio-immunoassay, homogenous mobility shift assay [HMSA]), and electrochemiluminescence immunoassay [ECLIA] for infliximab). Antibody levels cannot be compared directly. 
  - Assay choice based on cost, local availability, insurance & provider preference

---

## Optimal Trough Concentrations<sup>5</sup>
- Infliximab
  - Level of > 5mcg/mL is the **suggested*- trough level  
  - Many will dose-optimize patients to a level of > 10mcg/mL before discontinuing therapy and trying an alternate agent 
  - In perianal Crohn’s disease, higher trough levels ( ~20mcg/mL) were associated with increased fistula healing
  - Antibodies to infliximab (ATI) > 9.1U/mL during loss of remission associated with a LR of 3.6 for an unsuccessful intervention to overcome them

---

## Optimal Trough Concentrations (Continued)
- Adalimumab
  - Level of >7.5mcg/mL is the **suggested*- trough level when conducting TDM 

---

## Loss of Response Mechanisms<sup>6</sup>
Primary and secondary loss of response can be divided into: 
- **Mechanistic pharmacodynamic failure:*- optimal drug trough with failure to respond
- **Non-immune-mediated pharmacokinetic failure:*- low drug trough with absence of antibodies
- **Immune-mediated pharmacokinetic failure:*- low drug trough with either low or high antibodies

---

## Types of Therapeutic Drug Monitoring
- Reactive TDM
  - When symptoms worsen
  - Improves clinical care
  - Cost-effective
- Proactive TDM
  - During induction or maintenance
  - Withdrawing therapy
  - Data (mainly retrospective) show improved outcomes

# Pregnancy and the Patient with IBD

---

<style scoped>
  li {
    font-size: 34px;
  }
</style>

## Why Is This Topic Important?<sup>1</sup>
- Most patients are diagnosed with IBD between ages 20-40 years, which coincides with childbearing years
- IBD affects men and women equally
- Multidisciplinary care is warranted to achieve the best outcomes
- Many providers and patients are fearful of treatment during pregnancy and lactation
- Worsening disease activity is the greatest predictor of poor pregnancy outcomes for an patient with IBD
- Little evidence for many recommendations, since pregnant women are excluded from trials

---

## Known Risks for the Pregnant Patient with IBD
- Miscarriage
- Growth retardation
- Premature delivery
- Delivery complications
- Disease exacerbation

---

# Planning and the Care Team

---

## Preconception Planning<sup>2</sup>
- Ideal for individuals to be in remission 3-6 months prior to conception to increase likelihood of quiescence during pregnancy and in postpartum period
- Preconception visit is ideal to assess:
  – Disease state
  – Therapy plan
  – Nutritional status
  – Smoking cessation
  – Body weight

---

<style scoped>
  li {
    font-size: 34px;
  }
</style>

## Preconception Planning<sup>3</sup>
- Contraception: long-acting, reversible, and non-hormonal
  – Mindful of venous thromboembolism risk
  – Consider reduced efficacy of oral contraceptive pills with small bowel disease / resection
- Fertility rates in IBD are equivalent to non-IBD patients
- Patients with prior surgery including ileal pouch-anal anastomosis, ostomies, and proctectomy exhibit reduced fertility rates due to inflammation and fallopian tube scarring
- Active inflammation may also reduce fertility
- Increase in voluntary childlessness compared to non-IBD patients

---

<style scoped>
  li {
    font-size: 25px;
  }
</style>

## Ideal Care Team Roster<sup>4</sup>
The captains:
  1. Gastroenterologist with IBD expertise 
  2. Maternal-fetal medicine specialist

Access to, as needed: 
  1. Colorectal surgeon 
  2. Nutritionist
  3. Lactation consultant

**With knowledge and understanding of principles for managing IBD during pregnancy, you can manage these patients, too!**

---

# Disease Management

---

## Healthcare Maintenance<sup>5</sup>
- Use of prenatal vitamins is recommended, start early
- Iron may cause constipation can be managed with most over-the-counter preparations 
- Inadequate gestational weight gain has been tied to increased risk for small-for-gestational age infants born to mothers with IBD

---

## Medication Options: What Not To Use!<sup>6</sup>
- Steroids for maintenance
  – Best for patients to be in remission off steroids for 3 months before conception
  – May increase the risk of gestational diabetes, preterm birth, and low birthweight
- Methotrexate must be held 3 months before conception, given known teratogenecity

---

## Medication Options: What Not To Use! (Continued)
- Limited data for use of tofacitinib during pregnancy; 11 maternal exposures in the >1100 patients in the ulcerative colitis trials; most common outcome was healthy newborn
- Animal studies with tofacitinib have demonstrated fetal malformation at high doses; encouraged to avoid during the first trimester

---

## Medication Options: What Not To Use!
- Steroids for maintenance
  – Best for patients to be in remission off steroids for 3 months before conception
  – May increase the risk of gestational diabetes, preterm birth, and low birthweight
- Methotrexate must be held 3 months before conception, given known teratogenecity

---

## Medication Options: What Not To Use!
- Limited data for use of tofacitinib during pregnancy; 11 maternal exposures in the >1100 patients in the ulcerative colitis trials; most common outcome was healthy newborn
- Animal studies with tofacitinib have demonstrated fetal malformation at high doses; encouraged to avoid during the first trimester

---

## Medical Therapy<sup>7</sup>
- 5-ASA agents (oral and topical) may be continued throughout pregnancy 
  – All preparations are currently phthalate free
- Thiopurine monotherapy can be continued
  – Increased renal clearance may lower levels
  – Initiation during pregnancy is not recommended

---

## Medical Therapy (Continued)
- Steroids can be used as needed for flares
- Biologics can be continued with last dose timed during third trimester, ideally to deliver during trough
- Combination therapy is discouraged if possible, due to concern of infection risk

---

<style scoped>
  table {
    text-align: left;

</style>

## Medical Therapy: Biologics<sup>8</sup>
Drug | |
| - | -
Infliximab | Last infusion 6-10 weeks before delivery; resume postpartum
Adalimumab | Last injection 2-3 weeks before delivery; resume postpartum
Certolizumab | Continue uninterrupted
Golimumab | Last injection 4-6 weeks before delivery; resume postpartum
Vedolizumab | Last infusion 6-10 weeks before delivery; resume postpartum
Ustekinumab | Last infusion 6-10 weeks before delivery; resume postpartum

**Can resume biologics 24 hours after vaginal delivery and 48 hours after C-section**

---

## Disease Activity in Pregnancy: Assessment<sup>9</sup>
- 1/3 of patients will flare during their pregnancy
- Quiescence at the time of conception helps protect again flares
- Assessment of disease with endoscopy or imaging can be considered if findings will alter management
- Lab alterations may be seen in pregnancy including: 
  – Anemia
  – Reduced albumin
  – Elevated alk phos

---

## Disease Activity in Pregnancy<sup>10</sup>
- Flexible sigmoidoscopy can be performed (unsedated and unprepped) any time during gestation
- Colonoscopy after 24 weeks’ gestation may put the patient and pregnancy at risk
- Gadolinium should be avoided in pregnancy

---

<!-- _backgroundColor: white -->

## Active Disease<sup>11</sup>

![w:1100](d13.png)

---

<style scoped>
  li {
    font-size: 33px;
  }
</style>

## Perianal Disease in Pregnancy<sup>11</sup>
- Active perianal disease can be treated with standard of care measures
- Active disease (fistulas, fissures, stenosis) increase the risk of a 4th
degree tear 10x
- Thorough perianal exam during 3rd trimester can help determine the best mode of delivery
- Cesarean section is recommend for:
  – Prior rectovaginal fistula
  – Active perianal disease at the time of delivery
  – Special consideration for those with IPAA given need to preserve anal sphincter

---

# After Delivery

---

## Postpartum Needs: Thromboembolic Risk<sup>12</sup>
- IBD patients are at an increased risk for venous thromboembolism, as are pregnant women
- Mechanical prophylaxis and early ambulation are needed for all IBD patients after delivery
- Patients with C-section should be treated with prophylactic anticoagulation after surgery; course may extend up to 3-6 weeks postpartum

---

## Postpartum Needs: Pain Management<sup>13</sup>
- Short courses of opioids can be used
- Avoidance of codeine and tramadol
- Avoidance of NSAIDs, if possible
- Consideration of constipation and ileus, caused by pain medications

---

## Recommendations for the Newborn<sup>14</sup>
- Vaccines should be given on schedule
- Any baby exposed to a biologic during the third trimester should NOT be given live vaccines in the first 6 months of life
- Rotavirus delivery is the only impacted vaccine
- Live vaccines indicated at age 1 year (MMR, Varicella) can be given to breastfed babies of mothers taking biologics

# Surgical Considerations in IBD

---

## Surgery does NOT represent a medical failure, rather it is one of the treatment options.

---

## Risk of Requiring Surgery for IBD Management<sup>1</sup>
**Crohn’s disease**
- 1 year: 16.3%
- 5 years: 33.3%
- 10 years: 46.6%
- Cumulative: up to 70%-90% in some reports
**Ulcerative colitis**
- Cumulative risk of surgery over 25%

---

# Crohn’s Disease Surgeries

---

## Indications for Surgery<sup>2</sup>
- Persisting or recurrent obstruction
- Abscess
- Cancer
- Hemorrhage
- Bowel perforation 
- Poor quality of life

---

## Crohn’s Disease Surgery<sup>3</sup>
- Most common indication is for fibrostenotic disease segment
- Second most common indication is penetrating disease resulting in abscess or phlegmon usually in:
  — Presence of fistula
  — Presence of sinus

---

<!-- _backgroundColor: white -->

## Stricturing Disease<sup>4</sup>
- Approximately 19%-38% of patients with Crohn’s disease have stricturing or penetrating disease at the time of diagnosis
- 61%-88% will develop stricturing or penetrating disease after 20 years of disease

![w:1100](d14.png)

---

## Considerations for Surgery in Stricturing Crohn’s Disease
- Long stricture (> 4cm)
- Multiple strictures
- Strictures with associated abscesses or fistulae
- Suspicion of cancer as cause of blockage

---

## Considerations for Surgery in Stricturing Crohn’s Disease (Continued)
- Surgical options: 
  — Resection
  — Stricturoplasty
    - “Bowel-sparing” as it does not result in resection, but rather in reconfiguring the bowel to relieve a physical obstruction
    - Technique and reconfiguration depend on the length of the stricture and number of strictures to managed

## Management of Abscesses in Crohn’s Disease<sup>5</sup>

- Surgery is not always indicated
- Antibiotics should always be given
  - Abscesses < 3cm may be treated with antibiotics alone
- If possible, abscesses should be drained by interventional radiology
- Once abscess is drained biologics can be initiated
- Most patients who develop an abscess will need to undergo (delayed) resection
- Untreated abscess and phlegmon prior to surgery are associated with sepsis, leaks, and mortality postoperatively
- Long-term abscess resolution without surgery is unlikely (OR 3.44)

---

## Perianal Fistulas and Abscesses<sup>6</sup>
- Seen in approximately 25%-33% of patients with Crohn’s disease; most common fistula site
- Best evaluated with MRI of the pelvis
- Combined medical and surgical approach improves outcomes
- Exam under anesthesia with seton placement in the setting of abscesses, followed by initiation of anti-TNF medications
- Diverting colostomy in refractory cases

---

## Crohn’s Disease and Colorectal Cancer<sup>7</sup>
- Increased risk of colon cancer in Crohn’s disease, based on time since Crohn’s disease diagnosis and extent of disease
- Relative risk is 2.5 in CD and 5.6 in colonic CD
- Surveillance is recommended after 8 years of disease if > 30% of the colon is involved
- Slight increased risk of small intestinal cancer in Crohn’s disease with small intestinal involvement
  – 0.5/1000 person-years after 8 years
  – No surveillance recommended for this group

# Ulcerative Colitis Surgeries

---

## Indications for Surgery in Ulcerative Colitis
- Acute severe ulcerative colitis (ASUC) — Toxic megacolon
  — Perforation
  — Massive bleeding
  — Refractory to or intolerant of medical therapies
- Cancer

---

<!-- _backgroundColor: white -->

## Toxic Megacolon
![h:500](d16.png)

---

## Toxic Megacolon
But...
**Don’t have to have radiologic evidence to have toxic megacolon or to require surgery**

---

## Surgery in the Urgent Setting
- Subtotal colectomy is the preferred surgery with end ileostomy and Hartmann’s pouch creation
- Rectal mucosectomy and ileoanal pull-through are deferred until the patient is optimized
  – Nutritional status
  – Off steroids
  – Center of Excellence

---

## Ulcerative Colitis Surgical Options
![h:500](d17.png)

<style scoped>
  li {
    font-size: 33px;
  }
</style>

## Ileal Pouch Anal Anastomosis (IPAA)
- Most common surgery performed to restore bowel function in UC
- Important to set the patients expectations prior to surgery: 
  — Usually have 4-8 bms/day
  — Likely to have nocturnal BMs
  — Many experience incontinence that increases over time
- Most will have a 3-stage set of surgeries
  1. Subtotal colectomy
  2. Rectal mucosectomy and pouch creation with diverting loop ileostomy (DLI) 
  3. Takedown of DLI

---

## Ulcerative Colitis and Colon Cancer<sup>8</sup>
- Increased risk of colon cancer, based on time since ulcerative colitis diagnosis, extent of disease, and disease severity
- Standardized incidence ratio 7 compared to the general population 
  - Surveillance is recommended after 8-10 years of disease
  - Surveillance can start after 10-15 years of disease in limited left-sided disease
